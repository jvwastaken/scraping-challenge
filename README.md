## Code Sources:
- XPert Learning Assistance was used to help & correct my data for the following portions within [**Part 2**](Starter_Code/part_2_mars_weather.ipynb):
    1. Correcting the *for* loop to extract the proper elements within each row of the table.
    2. Correcting & reviewing code for the last scatter plot

- Modules 3 and 4 were used as reference for the data visualizations and `.groupby` functions.
